# CNN2SNN
This project aims to convert Artificial Neuron NetWork to Spiking Neuron Network , which represents the next generation of artificial intelligence. The motivation of proposing SNN is that it is more energy-efficient than ANN, and have more chances to be applied in embedded devices. The project consists of the following parts.
Training
Pruning
Convertion
Simulation
Validation
